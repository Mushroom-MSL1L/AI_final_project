* The project is a final project for NYCU CS AI course.

## Introduction
* It's a project that can analysis the hot comments of the steam game.
* By clicking down a game name in UI, this program will automatically search the top comments of the game, and llama will organize top comments as a brief summerization. 
* If you want to know whether a game is good or not, but you don't rely on the grading, besides, you don't want to look reviews one by one. This program is extraordinary suit for you. 

## On local machine
### How to set up 
* programming language
    * We are recommend to use `python 3.10` or higher.
* packages 
    * clone this project from GitHub, which means you run following command in your terminal, `git clone https://github.com/Mushroom-MSL1L/NYCU-AI-Final-Project-STEAM.git`
    * run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    * install pytorch from this url `https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/`. Choose correct packege for your need.
* model
    * This repo do not provide model, you need to download a one. 
    * Download ```llama-2-7B.Q4_k_M model``` as ```gguf``` file from [here](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGUF/blob/main/llama-2-7b-chat.Q4_K_M.gguf), so that you don't need to change any code.
    * Rename the file name as `llama-2-7b-chat.Q4_K_M.gguf`.
    * Make a folder whose name is `llama.cpp` under ```Model``` folder. And put your gguf file in it. There should has a path like ```NYCU-AI-Final-Project-STEAM\Model\llama.cpp\llama-2-7b-chat.Q4_K_M.gguf```
    * More information can take a look at `supplement.md`.
### How to use 
* cd to this folder `NYCU-AI-Final-Project-STEAM`
* run `chainlit run ui.py -w` in terminal
* open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`
* Type one game name you want to analysis
    * we recommend below games to test
        * "Cyberpunk 2077"
        * "Forza Horizon 4"
        * "Forza Horizon 5"
        * "The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt"
    * get more games from `game_list.txt`
* wait for a while, you will see the result.

## On Colab
### How to set up
* Upload `STEAM.ipynb` to google Colab notebook.
* Run the code one by one in the notebook.
    * `Download llm model` part may need 30 seconds
    * `llama-cpp-python GPU ver. install` part may need 20 minutes
* In `Run` part you need to update `add-authtoken` with your own token.
    * go to [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) and sign up.
    * get your token from [your-authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken)
    * Just press the `copy` button and paste it to the code.
    * like `!ngrok config add-authtoken 2hYXWxSKTePaAIU6Xb86s9EJgYa_53qzsH6jSz88QHBaKt4Ad`
* Keep run the remaining code, until it shows `http://localhost:8000`.
### How to use
* Click the link `http://localhost:8000` in the output.
* Type one game name you want to analysis
    * we recommend below games to test
        * "Cyberpunk 2077"
        * "Forza Horizon 4"
        * "Forza Horizon 5"
        * "The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt"
    * get more games from `game_list.txt`
* wait for a while, you will see the result.

## Hyperparameter
### model.py configuration
  In `class LLM`, you are able to change some parameter in `self.config`.
  * `max_token`: model terminates its output as it reaches the max token.
  * `n_ctx`: context window, input length for the llm. Here are the parameters for both the GPU and the CPU.
  * `n_batch`: batch size for the model. Here are the parameters for both the GPU and the CPU.
  * `n_gpu_layers`: num of gpu_layers for the model. Available only for GPU.
### chain.py configuration
 In `class chain` in chain.py you are able to change some parameters in `self.config`. 
* **`keywords`**: 
  * keywords for retrieving. But, you have to concider the max token of input if you add more.
* **`total_document_length`**: 
  * For max total_document tokens in prompt. 
  `total_document_length + template_prompt (approx. 40 words)` cannot exceed `n_ctx` in `Model/LLM`
* **`max_docs_length`**: 
  * For max document length for each document in prompt.`max_docs_length * num_of_keywords` must less than `total_document_length` at least.
* **`add_review_number`**: 
  * the number of review you want to add in vectordatabse for each games.
